# Homework 1: Docker, SQL and Terraform

Homework for Module 1: Containerization and Infrastructure as Code
[datatalks homework 1](https://courses.datatalks.club/de-zoomcamp-2026/homework/hw1)

## Question 1. Understanding docker first run 

> What's the version of pip in the python:3.13 image?

Run docker with the python:3.13 image in an interactive mode, use the entrypoint bash. $ python --version Python 3.13 <br>
```bash
docker run -it --entrypoint=bash python:3.13
```

To check the pip version in the docker image python:3.13 <br>
```bash 
pip --version
```

Answer: **pip 25.3**

## Question 2. Understanding Docker networking and docker-compose

> Given the docker-compose.yaml, what is the hostname and port that pgadmin should use to connect to the postgres database?

```bash
services:
  db:
    container_name: postgres
    image: postgres:17-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: 'postgres'
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: 'postgres'
      POSTGRES_DB: 'ny_taxi'
    ports:
      - '5433:5432'
    volumes:
      - vol-pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  pgadmin:
    container_name: pgadmin
    image: dpage/pgadmin4:latest
    environment:
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL: "pgadmin@pgadmin.com"
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: "pgadmin"
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - vol-pgadmin_data:/var/lib/pgadmin

volumes:
  vol-pgdata:
    name: vol-pgdata
  vol-pgadmin_data:
    name: vol-pgadmin_data
```

Inside the same docker-compose network, containers talk to each other using the service name (or container name) and the internal port, not the published one.

The docker-compose.yaml Postgres service is:
<br>service name: db 
<br>container_name: postgres
<br>internal port: 5432


Answer: **db:5432** and **postgres:5432**

## Prepare the Data

Download the green taxi trips data for November 2025:

```bash
wget https://d37ci6vzurychx.cloudfront.net/trip-data/green_tripdata_2025-11.parquet
```

You will also need the dataset with zones:

```bash
wget https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/misc/taxi_zone_lookup.csv
```

## Question 3. Counting short trips

> For the trips in November 2025 (lpep_pickup_datetime between '2025-11-01' and '2025-12-01', exclusive of the upper bound), how many trips had a `trip_distance` of less than or equal to 1 mile?

exclusive upper bound means: The upper limit value is NOT included in the range.

SELECT count(*) From green_trip 
WHERE lpep_pickup_datetime >= 2025-11-01 
AND lpep_pickup_datetime < 2025-12-01 
AND trip_destance <= 1

Answer: **8,007**

## Question 4. Longest trip for each day

> Which was the pick up day with the longest trip distance? Only consider trips with `trip_distance` less than 100 miles (to exclude data errors).

Use the pick up time for your calculations.

SELECT lpep_pickup_datetime FROM green_trip
WHERE trip_distance < 100
LIMIT 1

Answer: **2025-11-14** with trip_distance 88.03

## Question 5. Biggest pickup zone

> Which was the pickup zone with the largest `total_amount` (sum of all trips) on November 18th, 2025?

74	East Harlem North

Answer : **East Harlem North**


## Question 6. Largest tip

> For the passengers picked up in the zone named "East Harlem North" in November 2025, which was the drop off zone that had the largest tip?

Note: it's `tip` , not `trip`. We need the name of the zone, not the ID.

Answer: **Yorkville West** with the largest tip_amount = $81.89

## Terraform

In this section homework we'll prepare the environment by creating resources in GCP with Terraform.

In your VM on GCP/Laptop/GitHub Codespace install Terraform.
Copy the files from the course repo
[here](../../../01-docker-terraform/terraform/terraform) to your VM/Laptop/GitHub Codespace.

Modify the files as necessary to create a GCP Bucket and Big Query Dataset.


## Question 7. Terraform Workflow

> Which of the following sequences, respectively, describes the workflow for:
1. Downloading the provider plugins and setting up backend,
2. Generating proposed changes and auto-executing the plan
3. Remove all resources managed by terraform`

Answers:
- terraform import, terraform apply -y, terraform destroy
- teraform init, terraform plan -auto-apply, terraform rm
- terraform init, terraform run -auto-approve, terraform destroy
- terraform init, terraform apply -auto-approve, terraform destroy
- terraform import, terraform apply -y, terraform rm
